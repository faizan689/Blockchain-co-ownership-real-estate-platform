Project Title: Blockchain-Based Real Estate Co-Ownership Platform using ICP
Objective
To build a secure, transparent, and efficient platform that utilizes the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)
to tokenize real estate assets, allowing fractional ownership, seamless investment, and shared returns
through blockchain smart contracts.

• Property developers seeking diversified funding
• Asset management firms and REITs
Key Features
A. Property Tokenization
• Each property is represented as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) or fungible tokens (FTs)
• Tokens represent fractional ownership (e.g., 1 token = 1
• Smart contracts manage ownership rights, dividend distribution, and resale conditions
B. Investment Dashboard
• Real-time display of portfolio
• Track property value, ownership percentage, and estimated returns
• Token balance and transaction history
C. Marketplace for Properties
• Browse available tokenized real estate
• Filter by location, property type, risk level, expected ROI
• Token purchase through integrated crypto wallet (e.g., ICP wallet)
D. Smart Contract Engine
• Built on ICP canisters
• Automates dividend payout, property appreciation handling, co-owner voting
• Integrates with third-party oracles for real estate data
E. Voting Governance
• Token-based voting for co-owners
• Approve or deny changes like property maintenance, sale, or lease agreements
